Multiforum is an open-source platform designed to bring communities together through meaningful discussions, shared events, and collaborative knowledge building.

## Our Mission

We believe that healthy online communities are built on three pillars:
- **Open dialogue** through rich discussion tools
- **Shared experiences** via event coordination
- **Collective knowledge** through collaborative documentation

## Key Capabilities

**Discussion Forums**: Create topic-based communities with threaded conversations, voting systems, and comprehensive moderation tools.

**Event Discovery**: Find and organize local and online events with location-based search and integrated mapping.

**Wiki Systems**: Build shared knowledge bases with version control and collaborative editing.

**Moderation**: Maintain healthy communities with robust tools for content management and user administration.

## Open Source

Multiforum is built in the open with community contributions welcome. The project emphasizes transparency, extensibility, and user ownership of their data.
